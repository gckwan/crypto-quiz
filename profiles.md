### Profiles
Bitcoin - The OG cryptocurrency. The first block contained a message about the bank bailout during the 07-08 financial crisis, and early adopters had tended towards libertarian. "There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins" is a cornerstone idea that makes Bitcoin the antithesis of the money printing fiat currencies, and makes Bitcoin the 21st century replacement for Gold. Nowadays, Bitcoin is considered the base currency for all cryptocurrency trading pairs. It's conservative, reliable, risk averse.

Ethereum - The number two cryptocurrency. The founder of Ethereum envisioned a programmable layer for Bitcoin, but decided to create a new chain when he met opposition to the idea of making large changes to the Bitcoin protocol. A large number of innovative ideas like ICOs, Proof of Stake, DeFi, came from Ethereum. But at the same time, the Ethereum community gets constantly accused for being overly technical and naive about affecting change.

Bitcoin Cash - Bitcoin Cash is to Bitcoin as the Protestant movement is to Catholicism. The Bitcoin Cash community felt like Satoshi Nakamoto's vision was hijacked, and splintered off to create a cryptocurrency that could be used as a peer to peer electronic cash system, as the original whitepaper had stated.

Libra - The jock. Backed by Facebook, the 800 pound gorilla, Libra is endowed with all of the connections and resources in the world. Everyone in the cryptocurrency industry either hates them because they represent an existential threat to their blockchain, or wants to become their friend for the potential for unimaginable wealth. But they're still pre-release and there's always the chance that it gets completely scrapped before getting launched.

Binance Coin - Binance was a latecomer in the crowded cryptocurrency exchange industry that quickly rose to #1. Binance created Binance Coin to initially fund their operation, and gave fee discounts on Binance for users that owned Binance coin. Binance is the most profitable company in the entire cryptocurrency industry, and owning binance coin is the closest thing to owning a piece of the company.

Dogecoin - The original memecoin. Named after a Shiba Inu-turned-internet meme, the Dogecoin was explicitly created as a joke, yet a community of hardcore believers came together to lift the price up. Still a joke, yet somehow still kind of relevant.

ZCash - The original moon math coin. The founders performed an [elaborate ceremony](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/ceremony) in order to put to production an incomprehensibly complicated new cryptographic technique called "Zero Knowledge Proofs" to guarantee privacy in transactions. The founding team entirely consists of cryptography PhDs.

Ripple - The original San Francisco Venture Capital cryptocurrency. Ripple's strategy is to sign up banks to use their cryptocurrency for financial transactions.
